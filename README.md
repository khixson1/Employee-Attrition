Correlations between Attrition and Compensation-Related Data show that the highest attrition is related to whether or not an employee has to work overtime as well as lower levels of pay.  Those making under $4000/month are twice as likely as those making more than $4000/month to leave the company.  Perhaps re-evaluating overtime use and policies as well as paying the lowest-wage earners at least $4000K/month would decrease attrition for those job categories required to perform overtime and who make the least in the company.

In regards to employee demographics, men have slightly higher attrition rates than women, and single people are more likely to leave than compared with married or divorced people. People who are involved the most with business travel (Sales Force) have higher attrition rates.  This could be a reason why those with marketing degrees (who are most of the sales force) have higher attrition rates.  


![Experience_Coorelations](https://github.com/khixson1/Employee-Attrition/assets/8357088/8e92445d-5b55-493d-bf42-29a56dbf8105)
Regarding experience-related data, those who have changed jobs the most show higher attrition than those who have had few jobs in the past. When hiring new employees, consideration of job hopping frequency should be considered as a factor in potetial future attrition.

Correlations between Attrition and Job/Role/Degree-Related Data show that those with Doctorates have the lowest attrition rates and those with Marketing, Technical and Human Resources degrees have higher attrition than those with Medical and Life Sciences degrees in general.  The human resource degree holders show a large variance which indicates that there are compounding factors that contribute to attrition with human resource degree holders.  To counteract marketing and technical degree holder attrition, further exploration of the data is necessary to determine why these particular degree holders are more likely to leave.  Employees who work overtime also are mostly the technical degree holders which accounts for their higher attrition rates. Overall, the salesforce is the most likely employees to leave.
